Think about this for a moment —  what’s within arms reach of your bed tonight? Is it your phone by chance? Let’s say for arguments sake that you fall asleep with your phone but recently you’ve come to accept that you need to establish some digital boundaries. How would you go about changing that habit? Should you try to resist temptation and ignore your buzzing baby…&lt;em&gt;vrr&lt;/em&gt;..&lt;em&gt;vrr&lt;/em&gt;..? What if instead, you relocate your phone out of your bedroom. You’ll probably achieve your goal of less screen time without even trying. Maybe you have a good reason for keeping your phone bedside, my point is not to judge you on that but to explain how you can effortlessly influence your behaviour by mapping the design of your environment to your best intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed in grocery stores that vegetables are always at the entrance and the candy is always near the checkouts? Grocery stores are a masterclass of designed environmental influence. The problem is that they’re designed for their best intentions, not yours. So what’s their angle? It sounds silly but it has to do with how much will power we have when we enter versus when we exit. 
While we’re shopping we need to make lots of little decisions that wear us down- we search, sort and compare products repeatedly. When we’re at our strongest, we’re presented with the healthy stuff, and by the time we’ve had enough, we’re presented with the stuff we shouldn’t have, but find hard to resist! It’s also awkward to leave without buying anything, by design I’m sure… 
While we can’t change the design of our grocery store, by knowing how our behaviour is being subtlety influenced gives us strength to push back on the ‘architects’ of our experiences that do not have our best interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the virtual world, your environments are for the most part, your browser, your home screen and desktop. Take a look at your environments now — Maybe push the Facebook app to page two. Are you a browser tab addict? That sort of environment, like living in a messy apartment has its negatives. Most importantly perhaps, it discourages having a single focus. That’s usually a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hide the bookmarks bar and keep a good book next to the couch or bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design your living space to encourage the person you want to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch out for well designed environments that lead us towards someone else’s best intentions.&lt;/li&gt;
